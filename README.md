# AR Exposure Therapy

  Unity Mixed Reality application for Google Tango Lenovo Phab 2 Pro for exposure therapy with _snake_, _spider_ and _rat_.

## Description

  The  developed  MR  system  is  based  on  a  **_Google  Tango_**  smartphone  (Lenovo  Phab  2  Pro). This smartphone is equipped with motion tracking and depth sensors. It allows the systemto integrate depth information in a scene efficiently. The system will reconstruct the surface inthe  scene  including  its  illuminant  condition  and  will  detect  the  ground  plane  of  the  scene  andother planes as well with the support of Tango SDK. Then, a 3D model of a virtual animal willbe added to the reconstructed scene, and the scene with the animal will be rendered using Unitygame  engine.  The  rendered  image  will  be  shown  on  the  screen  of  the  smartphone  so  that  theimage will be seen by an observer using a VR smartphone holder (e.g., Google cardboard). Thesystem will operate this whole process in real time.

#### 2. Spider

  Selected spider is an **_Argiope bruennichi_** (wasp spider) female. We chose to use this spider because it is one of the most common spiders in Russia. Recognizing this spider in his habitation area is straightforward. Argiope bruennichi has a verybright wasp-like colour.
  
  List of animations:
  * idle,
  * hesitating,
  * defending pose (fear).

#### 3. Rat

  We  selected  rat  as  one  of  the  disgusting  and  frequently  faced  animal  inRussia.  For  example,  it  is  possible  to  meet  a  rat  in  the  Moscow  subway,  near  garbage  cans, in  cellars.  Some  people  consider  rats  as  potential  disease  carriers  what  cause  fear  and  phobicavoidance  of  this  animal.
