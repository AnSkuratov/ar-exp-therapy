# AR Exposure Therapy

  Unity Mixed Reality application for Google Tango Lenovo Phab 2 Pro for exposure therapy with _snake_, _spider_ and _rat_.

## Description

  The developed MR system is based on a **_Google  Tango_** smartphone (Lenovo Phab 2 Pro). This smartphone is equipped with motion tracking and depth sensors. It allows the system to integrate depth information in a scene efficiently. The system will reconstruct the surface in the scene including its illuminant condition and will detect the ground plane of the scene and other planes as well with the support of Tango SDK. Then, a 3D model of a virtual animal will be added to the reconstructed scene, and the scene with the animal will be rendered using Unity game engine. The rendered image will be shown on the screen of the smartphone so that the image will be seen by an observer using a VR smartphone holder (e.g., Google cardboard). The system will operate this whole process in real time.

  Selected spider is an [**_Argiope bruennichi_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argiope_bruennichi) (wasp spider) female. We chose to use this spider because it is one of the most common spiders in Russia. Recognizing this spider in his habitation area is straightforward. Argiope bruennichi has a very bright wasp-like colour.
  
  List of animations:
  * idle,
  * hesitating,
  * defending pose (fear).

  We selected rat as one of the disgusting and frequently faced animal in Russia. For example, it is possible to meet a rat in the Moscow subway, near garbage cans, in cellars. Some people consider rats as potential disease carriers what cause fear and phobic avoidance of this animal.

  List of animations:
  * idle,
